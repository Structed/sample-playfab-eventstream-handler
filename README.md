# PlayStream EventHandler Example for PlayFab & Azure Functions!

This repo contains a sample project built for my blog article: [Extending PlayFab - Reacting to PlayStream Events with Azure Functions](https://blog.structed.me/posts/extending-playfab-with-azure-functions)

## Prerequisites
* A free [PlayFab](https://playfab.com) account (free)
* An Azure account - get one free at [azure.com/gaming](https://azure.com/gaming)


> **WARNING**: Although the Azure account is free and includes some free products, it might still incur some cost. While it should not be much for this example, you have been warned :-)
